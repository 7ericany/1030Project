# 1030 Project

### COVID-19 New Cases Prediction on Country-based Time Series

Here is the GitHub repository of my DATA1030 final project. In this project, I developed a linear regression model, an SVR, and an XGBoost model to make COVID-19 new cases prediction. Time series analysis is also implemented with ARIMA models. Fantastic figures are included in the `./figures` folder.
